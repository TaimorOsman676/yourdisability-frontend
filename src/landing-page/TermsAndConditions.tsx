        <p className="text-gray-900">
          Any dispute or claim related to your use of this website will be
          resolved through binding arbitration rather than in court, except for
          claims that qualify to be heard in small claims court. This
          arbitration agreement extends to claims against our clients, vendors,
          and marketing partners, who are third-party beneficiaries of this
          agreement. The Federal Arbitration Act governs this agreement.
        </p>
        <p className="py-4 text-gray-900">
          In arbitration, there is no judge or jury, and court review of
          arbitration awards is limited. However, an arbitrator may award the
          same damages or relief as a court, and must follow the terms of these
          conditions.
        </p>
        <p className="py-4 text-gray-900">
          We both agree that disputes will be resolved only on an individual
          basis, not as part of a class or consolidated action. If a claim
          proceeds in court instead of arbitration, both parties waive the right
          to a jury trial.
