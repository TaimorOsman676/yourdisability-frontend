            What are Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) Benefits?
          </h2>
          <p className="text-gray-700">
            Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) is a federally funded
            program managed by the U.S. Social Security Administration (SSA).
            These benefits provide financial support to you and eligible family
            members if you have a medical condition that prevents you from
            working for at least 12 months or is expected to be
            life-threatening. To qualify, you must have earned enough work
            credits through your employment history. Statistics show that a
            20-year-old worker has a 1-in-4 likelihood of becoming disabled
            before reaching retirement age.

            How Your Earnings Impact Social Security Disability
          </h2>
          <p className="text-gray-500">
            To qualify for benefits under the Social Security Administration
            (SSA) guidelines, your impairment must be severe enough to prevent
            you from performing and maintaining substantial gainful employment.
            The SSA sets a minimum income threshold each year; if your earnings
            exceed this limit, you won't be eligible for benefits. Additionally,
            your impairment must meet one of the following conditions:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-4 text-gray-500">

            How to File a Social Security Claim
          </h2>
          <p className="text-gray-500">
            If you believe you qualify for SSDI benefits, the first step is to
            submit an application to initiate your claim. There are several ways
            to file this initial application.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-500">
            SSDI, or Social Security Disability Insurance, provides benefits to
            individuals who have worked and paid Social Security taxes.
            Generally, if you have worked at least five out of the past ten
            years, you may be eligible. Once you become disabled and can no
            longer work, it's important to start the process by filing an
            initial claim. This notifies the Social Security Administration that
            you are seeking SSDI benefits.

            Applicants must also have sufficient work history to be eligible for

          <p className="text-gray-500">
            Social Security Disability benefits are earned through the taxes you
            pay while working. However, some applicants may not need to meet the
            work requirements. Supplemental Security Income (SSI), a needs-based
            program, is available to individuals with low income and limited
            resources who don't qualify for SSDI.
